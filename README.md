# 👨🏾‍💻 Andrew Muchangi – Art Meets Code

**Creative Technologist | Embedded Rust Explorer | Game Dev**

I live at the intersection of logic and spirit — blending low-level systems, game engines, and web tools to tell stories, build tools, and awaken ideas. My work ranges from microcontroller firmware to culturally-rooted game worlds.

## 🧘🏾‍♂️ Philosophy

> *“When I write code, I sketch ideas. When I draw, I simulate spirit.  
> Art and logic aren’t opposites—they’re just two tools to explore the same mystery.”*
